#My first post  

Hi, I'm Cippo95, I'm an italian guy studying computer science engineering.
I like the GNU/Linux world but a lot of stuff needs some configuring.

Last year I thought to keep a log of everything I was doing after fresh install.
It was just to keep track of what I needed in case I needed to fresh install again.

Now I have read about GitHub pages and I thought that I could write here what I do.
Maybe this will help someone other than me.

Right now I have a dual boot system with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Fedora 35.
I recommend Ubuntu LTS releases to everyone new to Linux, but it will keep some old package for "stability" reasons.
If you instead have some experience and you want to try (almost) the latest software try Fedora.
