title: "HP PSC 1510 All-in-One scanner on Fedora"  
---

I have this old all in one printer that I use only to scan.
> I use a Samsung Xpress SL-M2023 to print stuff that even needs its own driver to work!

For some reason the scanner is not detected by default and I have fixed installing libsane-hpaio  
`sudo dnf install libsane-hpaio`

and adding my user to the group lp  

`sudo usermod --append --groups lp <user>`

> <user> is your user name!

After this you will need to restart your session!
