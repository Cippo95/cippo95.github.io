title: "Ubuntu log the beginning"

My log says that after the fresh minimal install, after the first reboot, everything was stuck except for the top bar.
Another reboot fixed it.

I have a GTX1060 maybe it was Nouveau's drivers fault.
If you have an Nvidia card I recommend to install Nvidia proprietary drivers as soon as possibile.
If you want a good and open source driver use AMD Radeon GPUs or Intel IGPs.

Not hating on Nouveau, I understand that Nvidia is not collaborating that much.

To be honest I think that at this point I was using Ubuntu 21.04:
- I have switched to 20.04 after having tried 21.10:
	- I hated the new GNOME horizontal workspaces.
	- I had some problem with MySQL installation with 21.10.
