The great beginning of this log is:

"After the reboot after the install GNOME was stuck except for the top bar, another reboot fixed it."

I have a GTX1060 6GB so maybe it was Nouveau's drivers fault.
I recommend if you have an Nvidia graphics card to install their proprietary drivers asap.
Not hating on Nouveau: Nvidia is not collaborating that much for an open source driver.

If you want a good and open source driver use AMD Radeon GPUs or Intel IGPs.
