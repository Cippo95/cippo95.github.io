title: Firefox videos freeze with ffmpeg free on Fedora
---
Using Firefox I had an issue with videos freezing when jumping to a timestamp.  
I use Fedora's standard dnf install of Firefox.

> Clicking on a timestamp on comments or with the mouse on the time would make the video become a still frame with the audio still working.  

The issue was Fedora's "free" (open source) version of ffmpeg: I have installed the version from RPM fusion and it works well.
